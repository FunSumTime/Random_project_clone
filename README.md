# MedMatch — Random Triage Trainer (Vanilla JS)

**What this is:**  
A tiny ER triage trainer. The app loads a pool of patient *case templates* (demographics, symptoms, vitals ranges), shows one case, you pick an ESI level (1–5), get feedback, and move to the next case. Educational demo only — not medical advice.

**Randomness in this app:**  
- Picks a random case each round from `data/cases.json`.  
- Generates **random vitals** by sampling within each case’s `vitalsRanges` (HR, RR, SBP, SpO₂, Temp °C).  
- Optionally adds a random **extra symptom** from `optionalSymptoms` when present.

**About the CSS:**  
The initial `style.css` was AI-assisted (generated by ChatGPT) and then lightly tweaked by me. All HTML/JS logic was written by me.
